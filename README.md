# 🧠 ATLAS – Automated Task Learning and Assistance System

ATLAS is your intelligent virtual assistant, inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S. from Iron Man. Built for speed, elegance, and practical utility, ATLAS merges voice interaction, real-time transcription, image recognition, and LLM-based reasoning into a seamless assistant you can run locally. Designed by [Kavin Lajara](https://github.com/your-profile), ATLAS is a step toward human-AI symbiosis that feels intuitive and powerful.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ **Voice Interaction** – Whisper-powered STT with real-time transcription and command recognition.
- 🧠 **Custom LLM Integration** – Plug in models like LLaMA 3, GPT, or any HF-hosted LLM.
- 📸 **Vision Support** – Real-time image interpretation and scene analysis via multimodal models.
- 💬 **Conversational Memory** – Session-aware recall for natural and continuous interactions.
- 🗣️ **Voice Cloning (XTTS)** – Fast and accurate TTS with voice personalization.
- 🔧 **Modular Architecture** – Easy to extend or swap components (TTS, STT, LLM).
- ⚙️ **System Diagnostics** – Real-time reporting of CPU, GPU, RAM, and disk usage.
- 🧪 **Experimental Mode** – Test new commands, plugins, or datasets in isolation.

## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- CUDA 12.6+ (for GPU acceleration)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- FFmpeg installed and added to PATH
- (Optional) GPU with ≥ 8GB VRAM for real-time TTS/vision

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/atlas.git
cd atlas
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run
bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
💡 Tip: You can configure startup parameters and agent personality in config/settings.yaml.

🧩 Components
Module	Tech	Purpose
stt/	OpenAI Whisper	Converts spoken input to text
tts/	Coqui XTTS v2	Speaks responses using cloned voices
vision/	OpenCV + CLIP	Performs image or webcam-based visual tasks
llm/	LLaMA / GPT	Core language reasoning engine
memory/	Redis / local	Contextual memory and recall
ui/	React (optional)	Web-based interface or 3D visualizer

🧠 Personality
ATLAS uses a custom prompt style reflecting efficiency, wit, and formality. It is designed to:

Provide helpful, succinct answers.

Offer insights from self-help and productivity literature.

Respond with humor when appropriate.

Reference historical and cultural knowledge when relevant.

Example:

User: What’s your system status?
ATLAS: All systems are nominal. CPU at 23%, memory at 58%, GPU standing by. Shall I prepare the neural cores for model fine-tuning?

📈 Roadmap
 Plugin system for external commands (e.g. smart home, file ops)

 Fine-tuned ATLAS LLM with embedded memory

 AR/VR support with camera integration

 Web dashboard and mobile remote
